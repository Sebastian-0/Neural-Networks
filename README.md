# Neural-Networks
A small lightweight neural network library written entirely in Python.

The following features have been implemented:
* Fully connected layers (logistic sigmoid, tanh, linear and ReLU activations)
* SGD and Momentum optimizers
* L1 and L2 regularization (lasso and ridge regression)
* Mean squared loss and binary Cross entropy loss
* Mini-batches are used during training
* Built-in support for validation


## Running
To run just import the relevant code from the "feedforward" folder and follow the examples in the "tests" folder.
